# üíª Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to predict the price of a laptop based on various features such as brand, RAM, storage, processor type, GPU, screen resolution, etc. The objective is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the price of a laptop using machine learning techniques.

The final deployed model uses **RandomForestRegressor**, which achieved the **highest R¬≤ score** and **lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** among all evaluated models.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset was scraped from various e-commerce platforms and cleaned before modeling. It contains the following features:

- Brand / Company
- Model Name
- RAM (in GB)
- Storage (HDD, SSD, etc.)
- Processor type
- GPU (Graphics Card)
- Operating System
- Screen Size
- Screen Resolution
- Touchscreen or not
- IPS Panel or not
- Weight
- Price (Target Variable)

## üìà Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Converted categorical columns using encoding.
- Extracted numeric resolution from screen details.
- Combined memory components into structured features (HDD, SSD, etc.).
- Converted "yes"/"no" fields into binary format.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

Used **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters for `RandomForestRegressor`, such as:

- `n_estimators`
- `random_state`
- `max_samples`
- `max_features`
- `max_depth`

---

## ‚úÖ Final Model

- **Algorithm**: RandomForestRegressor
- **R¬≤ Score**: *Highest among all models*
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: *Lowest*
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: GridSearchCV
